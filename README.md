# Comparison-Based-Sorting-Algorithms-
Comparison Based Sorting Algorithm and their time complexity.

. Insertion_Sort.java and Merge_Sort.java contains code to perform insertion and merge sort. 
• Quick_Sort_Inplace.java contains code for in place quick sort. • Quick_Median_of_3.java contains code to implement quicksort using median of 3 approach. 
• Quick_Small_Subproblem.java contains code to implement quick sort if the input array length is greater than 10. This class calls insertion sort, if the array length is less than or equal to 10. 
• Performance.java takes the size of the array as input and calculates the time take to execute each sorting algorithm. 
• Sorted_Reversesorted.java contains code to measure the time taken to sort a sorted array and an inverted sorted array. 
• Sorting_Algorithm.java contains the main class which takes the size and range of the input array and generates an array of random members. It prompts the user to select the sorting algorithm to sort this random number array. It also computes the time taken to sort the random array selected by the user. It also displays the sorted array.
